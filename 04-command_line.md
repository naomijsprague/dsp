# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of commands and what they do, focused on things that are new, interesting, or otherwise worth remembering.

> pwd : Print working directory (oh no where am I)
> cd : move to a specified directory
> touch : creates a file if there isn't one already present
> mkdir : creates a new directory
> man : to find the manual/documentation for a function
> git init: initialize a directory for git versioning
> git status: checks the status of versioning (have there been changes/new files since previous version?)
> echo : prints the current value of variable in the environment
> * is a wildcard

What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?

> ls lists files in the current directory
> ls -a lists files including hidden files that begin with a "."
> ls -l lists files and their sizes + other metadata
> ls -lh lists files and other metadata, restricts filesize to a format with 3 characters

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

> xargs passes long lists of arguments to a command by breaking them into smaller lists that are short enough to be accepted by the command. xs
